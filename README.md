## 🧠 Matching Algorithm

Each neighborhood has 3 parameters:
- safety (1–10)
- greenery (1–10)
- affordability (1–10)

User input weights these preferences, and the app computes a **weighted average** score for each neighborhood:

score = (
safety_input × safety_score +
greenery_input × greenery_score +
affordability_input × affordability_score
) / total_input_weight
